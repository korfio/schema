# schema

This repo contains **structs** derived from the schemas found on <http://schema.org>.

It includes all the extensions:  
* [ext-attic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/master/data/releases/3.3/ext-attic.jsonld)
* [ext-auto](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/master/data/releases/3.3/ext-auto.jsonld)
* [ext-bib](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/master/data/releases/3.3/ext-bib.jsonld)
* [ext-health-lifesci](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/master/data/releases/3.3/ext-health-lifesci.jsonld)
* [ext-meta](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/master/data/releases/3.3/ext-meta.jsonld)
* [ext-pending](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/master/data/releases/3.3/ext-pending.jsonld)
* [core schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/master/data/releases/3.3/schema.jsonld)

The script to generate the `schema.go` file is also included. There is plenty of room for improvement.

This file may not be useful on its own, but it will give a headstart for projects that are using <http://schema.org>.
